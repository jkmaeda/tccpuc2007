# 🍻 Biometric Payment System for Bars and Clubs

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my **Final Year Project (TCC)** in **Computer Science** at **PUC-SP**, supervised by **Prof. Giorno**. The project was originally hosted on Google Code and has been migrated here for archival purposes.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The application introduces a biometric-based payment system tailored for bars, nightclubs, and similar venues. By utilising fingerprint authentication, customers can seamlessly link their identity to their consumption, allowing them to enjoy services without the need for physical payment methods or waiting in queues upon exit.

### 🔐 Key Features

- **Fingerprint Identification**: Secure and swift customer recognition.
- **Cashless Transactions**: Eliminates the need for wallets or cards.
- **Real-time Consumption Tracking**: Monitor orders as they happen.
- **Queue-free Checkout**: Streamlined exit process without delays.
- **Administrative Interface**: Manage menus, customer profiles, and consumption records.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Biometric SDK**: Microsoft
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse IDE

## 🏛️ Academic Information

- **Institution**: Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo (PUC-SP)
- **Course**: Bachelor of Computer Science
- **Supervisor**: Prof. Fernando Antônio de Castro Giorno
- **Year**: 2007
